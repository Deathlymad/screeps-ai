/*
 * To Do List:
 
 * GENERAL:
 * - implement a more object oriented creep logic
 * - add memory watch
 * - create evaluators
 
 * SPAWNING:
 * - dynamic spawn algorithm (creation and cleanup of creep objects)
 * - predict death and provide exact timed replacement
 
 * TASK MANAGEMENT:
 * - make mining task terminate so it can switch
 * - for specialization it would be good if dedicated miners could force out temps
 * - reschedule upgrade tasks
 
 * LAYOUT:
 * - define extension / consumer groups
 * - design route planner
 
 * FUTURE:
 * - defense
 * - implement trading diplo
 * - find deadlock states
 
 * KNOWN BUGS:
 * - screep got killed in fight and respawned before on death triggered => uniquification of names
