/*
 * To Do List
 * - cleanup task data from creep
 * - make upgrade task terminate so it can switch
 * - assign transports
 * - dynamic spawn algorithm (creation and cleanup of creep objects)
 * - implement a more object oriented creep logic
 * - for specialization it would be good if dedicated miners could force out temps
 * - add memory watch
 * - design route planner
 * - create evaluators
 * - defense
 * - predict death and provide exact timed replacement
